### Legal services for Florida businesses and entrepreneurs

Florida businesses rely on Ross Chartered to provide quality legal advice to create, grow, and sustain their businesses and entrepreneurial ventures.

	* Licensing

* Technologically sophisticated relationship management and private communications

#### Transactional Retainers

Ross Chartered offers extraordinarily attractive rates compared to tradition legal providers. Potential clients who seek general counsel and transactional work should expect to retain the firm on a monthly basis for at least 3 months. The monthly rates and hours are:

* Starting: $500 for 2 hours
* Moving: $1000 for 5 hours
* Humming: $1500 for 8 hours

Ross Chartered regularly provides continued support to its clients' operations when they need more time in any given month. The additional hourly rates are lower for clients who are humming.  

#### Litigation Retainers

Businesses that are preparing to litigate, currently litigating or who seek litigation support should contact Ross Chartered for a custom solution based on the project. Ross Chartered regularly counsels alternative dispute resolutions, but maintains a strong toolkit and solid network to litigate any opponent. Litigation retainers are typically grounded in an hourly fee invoiced monthly, but contingency arrangements are available on a case-by-case basis.

#### Project-based Counsel

Ross Chartered also regularly works with businesses on a project basis at higher hourly rates or fixed fees. For instance, the firm regularly prepares and drafts non-disclosure agreements for businesses in wide-ranging industries for a fixed fee.
