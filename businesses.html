	<h4>Retainers</h4>
</div>
<div>
	<h5>Transactional</h5>
</div>
<div>
	<p>Ross Chartered offers extraordinary rates. Prospective clients who seek general counsel and transactional work should expect to retain the firm on a monthly basis for at least 3 months:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Starting: $500 for 2 hours</li>
		<li>Moving: $1000 for 5 hours</li>
		<li>Operating: $1500 for 8 hours</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Of course, Ross Chartered regularly provides continued support when clients need more attention in any given month. The additional hourly rates are lower for clients who are operating.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h5>Litigation</h5>
</div>
<div>
	<p>Businesses that are preparing to litigate, currently litigating or who seek litigation support should contact Ross Chartered for a custom solution based on the project. Ross Chartered regularly counsels alternative dispute resolutions, but maintains a strong toolkit and solid network to litigate any opponent. Litigation retainers are typically grounded in an hourly fee invoiced monthly, but contingency arrangements are available on a case-by-case basis.

	<h5>Project-based Counsel</h5>
</div>
<div>
	<p>Ross Chartered also works on independent projects. For instance, the firm regularly prepares and drafts non-disclosure agreements for businesses in wide-ranging industries for a fixed fee. Ross Chartered also welcomes clients who have started projects but seek professional advice to ensure their work has the intended effect.</p>
